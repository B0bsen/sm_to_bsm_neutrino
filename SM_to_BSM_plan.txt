From SM to BSM: road map

Introduction:
- Brief introduction to density matrix formulation of QM
- Relate to neutrino physics, introduce necessary quantities
- Overview and functional details for SQuIDS

Installation of SQuIDS: (provide shell script which automates this)
- Create Library folder in which to store SQuIDS and GSL
- install GSL
- Pull SQuIDS repo master branch
- ./configure -> make -> make test -> make install

Exercises: (provide cheat sheet)
- Get acquainted with SU_vector class:
	- Projectors
	- vacuum Hamiltonian
	- Rotation from mass to flavor basis
- Vacuum neutrino oscillations:
	- Create class vacuum derived from abstract SQuIDS base class
		- provide necessary functions
		- use SU_vector knowledge
